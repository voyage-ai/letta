    Args:
        label (str): The memory block to edit, identified by its label.
        patch (str): The simplified unified-diff patch text composed of context (" "), deletion ("-"), and addition ("+") lines. Optional
            lines beginning with "@@" can be used to delimit hunks. Do not include visual line numbers or warning banners.

    Examples:
        Simple replacement:
            label="human",
            patch:
                @@
                -Their name is Alice
                +Their name is Bob

        Replacement with surrounding context for disambiguation:
            label="persona",
            patch:
                @@
                 Persona:
                -Friendly and curious
                +Friendly, curious, and precise
                 Likes: Hiking

        Insertion (no deletions) between two context lines:
            label="todos",
            patch:
                @@

    Returns:
        str: A success message if the patch applied cleanly; raises ValueError otherwise.
