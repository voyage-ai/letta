<Tip>To use Letta with the DeepSeek API, set the environment variable `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=...`</Tip>

You can use Letta with [DeepSeek](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/) if you have a DeepSeek account and API key. Once you have set your `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in your environment variables, you can select what model and configure the context window size.
<Warning>
Please note that R1 doesn't natively support function calling in DeepSeek API and V3 function calling is unstable, which may result in unstable tool calling inside of Letta agents.
</Warning>
<Warning>
The DeepSeek API for R1 is often down. Please make sure you can connect to DeepSeek API directly by running:
```bash
curl https://api.deepseek.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEEPSEEK_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
        "model": "deepseek-reasoner",
        "messages": [
          {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
          {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
        ],
        "stream": false
      }'
```
</Warning>

## Enabling DeepSeek with Docker

To enable DeepSeek models when running the Letta server with Docker, set your `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` as an environment variable:
```bash
# replace `~/.letta/.persist/pgdata` with wherever you want to store your agent data
docker run \
  -v ~/.letta/.persist/pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 8283:8283 \
  -e DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your_deepseek_api_key" \
  letta/letta:latest
```

See the [self-hosting guide](/guides/selfhosting) for more information on running Letta with Docker.
