<Tip>To use Letta with Together.AI, set the environment variable `TOGETHER_API_KEY=...`</Tip>

You can use Letta with Together.AI if you have an account and API key. Once you have set your `TOGETHER_API_KEY` in your environment variables, you can select what model and configure the context window size.

## Enabling Together.AI with Docker

To enable Together.AI models when running the Letta server with Docker, set your `TOGETHER_API_KEY` as an environment variable:
```bash
# replace `~/.letta/.persist/pgdata` with wherever you want to store your agent data
docker run \
  -v ~/.letta/.persist/pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 8283:8283 \
  -e TOGETHER_API_KEY="your_together_api_key" \
  letta/letta:latest
```

See the [self-hosting guide](/guides/selfhosting) for more information on running Letta with Docker.
