<Tip>To enable OpenAI models with Letta, set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment variables. </Tip>

You can use Letta with OpenAI if you have an OpenAI account and API key. Once you have set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment variables, you can select what model and configure the context window size.

Currently, Letta supports the following OpenAI models:
- `gpt-4` (recommended for advanced reasoning)
- `gpt-4o-mini` (recommended for low latency and cost)
- `gpt-4o`
- `gpt-4-turbo` (*not* recommended, should use `gpt-4o-mini` instead)
- `gpt-3.5-turbo` (*not* recommended, should use `gpt-4o-mini` instead)


## Enabling OpenAI models with Docker

To enable OpenAI models when running the Letta server with Docker, set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable:
```bash
# replace `~/.letta/.persist/pgdata` with wherever you want to store your agent data
docker run \
  -v ~/.letta/.persist/pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 8283:8283 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key" \
  letta/letta:latest
```

See the [self-hosting guide](/guides/selfhosting) for more information on running Letta with Docker.

## Specifying agent models
When creating agents on your self-hosted server, you must specify both the LLM and embedding models to use via a *handle*. You can additionally specify a context window limit (which must be less than or equal to the maximum size).

```python
from letta_client import Letta
import os

# Connect to your self-hosted server
client = Letta(base_url="http://localhost:8283")

openai_agent = client.agents.create(
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    embedding="openai/text-embedding-3-small",  # An embedding model is required for self-hosted
    # optional configuration
    context_window_limit=16000
)
```

<Note>
For Letta Cloud usage, see the [quickstart guide](/quickstart). Cloud deployments manage embeddings automatically and don't require provider configuration.
