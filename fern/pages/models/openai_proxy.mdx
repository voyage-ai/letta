title: OpenAI-compatible endpoint
slug: guides/server/providers/openai-proxy
---

<Warning>
OpenAI proxy endpoints are not officially supported and you are likely to encounter errors.
We strongly recommend using providers directly instead of via proxy endpoints (for example, using the Anthropic API directly instead of Claude through OpenRouter).
For questions and support you can chat with the dev team and community on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/letta).
</Warning>

<Note>
To use OpenAI-compatible (`/v1/chat/completions`) endpoints with Letta, those endpoints must support function/tool calling.
</Note>

You can configure Letta to use OpenAI-compatible `ChatCompletions` endpoints by setting `OPENAI_API_BASE` in your environment variables (in addition to setting `OPENAI_API_KEY`).

## OpenRouter example

Create an account on [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai), then [create an API key](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys).

Once you have your API key, set both `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_BASE` in your environment variables.

## Using with Docker
Set the environment variables when you use `docker run`:
```bash
# replace `~/.letta/.persist/pgdata` with wherever you want to store your agent data
docker run \
  -v ~/.letta/.persist/pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 8283:8283 \
  -e OPENAI_API_BASE="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1" \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key" \
  letta/letta:latest
```

See the [self-hosting guide](/guides/selfhosting) for more information on running Letta with Docker.

Once the Letta server is running, you can select OpenRouter models from the ADE dropdown or via the Python SDK.

For information on how to configure agents to use OpenRouter or other OpenAI-compatible endpoints providers, refer to [our guide on using OpenAI](/models/openai).
