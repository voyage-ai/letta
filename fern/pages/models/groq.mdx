<Tip>To use Letta with Groq, set the environment variable `GROQ_API_KEY=...`</Tip>

You can use Letta with Groq if you have a Groq account and API key. Once you have set your `GROQ_API_KEY` in your environment variables, you can select what model and configure the context window size.

## Enabling Groq with Docker

To enable Groq models when running the Letta server with Docker, set your `GROQ_API_KEY` as an environment variable:
```bash
# replace `~/.letta/.persist/pgdata` with wherever you want to store your agent data
docker run \
  -v ~/.letta/.persist/pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 8283:8283 \
  -e GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key" \
  letta/letta:latest
```

See the [self-hosting guide](/guides/selfhosting) for more information on running Letta with Docker.
