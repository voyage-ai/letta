<Tip>To enable Google AI models with Letta, set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in your environment variables. </Tip>

You can use Letta with Google AI if you have a Google API account and API key. Once you have set your `GEMINI_API_KEY` in your environment variables, you can select what model and configure the context window size.

## Enabling Google AI with Docker

To enable Google Gemini models when running the Letta server with Docker, set your `GEMINI_API_KEY` as an environment variable:
```bash
# replace `~/.letta/.persist/pgdata` with wherever you want to store your agent data
docker run \
  -v ~/.letta/.persist/pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 8283:8283 \
  -e GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key" \
  letta/letta:latest
```

See the [self-hosting guide](/guides/selfhosting) for more information on running Letta with Docker.
