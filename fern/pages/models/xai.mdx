<Tip>To enable xAI (Grok) models with Letta, set `XAI_API_KEY` in your environment variables. </Tip>

## Enabling xAI (Grok) models
To enable the xAI provider, set your key as an environment variable:
```bash
export XAI_API_KEY="..."
```
## Enabling xAI with Docker

To enable xAI models when running the Letta server with Docker, set your `XAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable:
```bash
# replace `~/.letta/.persist/pgdata` with wherever you want to store your agent data
docker run \
  -v ~/.letta/.persist/pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 8283:8283 \
  -e XAI_API_KEY="your_xai_api_key" \
  letta/letta:latest
```

See the [self-hosting guide](/guides/selfhosting) for more information on running Letta with Docker.

## Specifying agent models

When creating agents on your self-hosted server, you must specify both the LLM and embedding models to use. You can additionally specify a context window limit (which must be less than or equal to the maximum size).

```python
from letta_client import Letta
import os

# Connect to your self-hosted server
client = Letta(base_url="http://localhost:8283")

agent = client.agents.create(
    model="xai/grok-2-1212",
    embedding="openai/text-embedding-3-small",  # An embedding model is required for self-hosted
    # optional configuration
    context_window_limit=30000
)
```
xAI (Grok) models have very large context windows, which will be very expensive and high latency. We recommend setting a lower `context_window_limit` when using xAI (Grok) models.

<Note>
For Letta Cloud usage, see the [quickstart guide](/quickstart). Cloud deployments manage embeddings automatically and don't require provider configuration.
