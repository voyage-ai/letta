## Search result format

<Info>
**What agents receive:** Each result contains:
- `content` - The stored text
- `tags` - Associated tags
- `timestamp` - When the memory was created
- `relevance` - Scoring with `rrf_score`, `vector_rank`, `fts_rank`

Letta uses **hybrid search** combining semantic (vector) and keyword (full-text) search, ranked using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Higher `rrf_score` means more relevant.
</Info>

## Writing effective queries

Letta uses OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` model, which handles natural language questions well. Agents can use various query styles:

**Natural language questions work best:**

```python
# What the agent does (agent tool call)
archival_memory_search(query="How does the test work?")
# Returns: "The Voight-Kampff test measures involuntary emotional responses..."
```

**Keywords also work:**

```python
# What the agent does (agent tool call)
archival_memory_search(query="replicant lifespan")
# Returns memories containing both keywords and semantically related concepts
```

**Concept-based queries leverage semantic understanding:**

```python
# What the agent does (agent tool call)
archival_memory_search(query="artificial memories")
# Returns: "...experimental replicant with implanted memories..."
# (semantic match despite different terminology)
```

<Tip>
**Pagination:** Agents receive multiple results per search. If an agent doesn't paginate correctly, you can instruct it to adjust the `page` parameter or remind it to iterate through results.
</Tip>

## Filtering by time

Agents can search by date ranges:

```python
# What the agent does (agent tool call)

# Recent memories
archival_memory_search(
    query="test results",
    start_datetime="2025-09-29T00:00:00"
)

# Specific time window
archival_memory_search(
    query="replicant cases",
    start_datetime="2025-09-29T00:00:00",
    end_datetime="2025-09-30T23:59:59"
)
```

<Info>
**Agent datetime awareness:**
- Agents know the current day but not the current time
- Agents can see timestamps of messages they've received
- Agents cannot control insertion timestamps (automatic)
- Developers can backdate memories via SDK with `created_at`
- Time filtering enables queries like "what did we discuss last week?"
</Info>

## Tags and organization

Tags help agents organize and filter archival memories. **Agents always know what tags exist in their archive** since tag lists are compiled into the context window.

**Common tag patterns:**
- `user_info`, `professional`, `personal_history`
- `documentation`, `technical`, `reference`
- `conversation`, `milestone`, `event`
- `company_policy`, `procedure`, `guideline`

**Tag search modes:**
- Match any tag
- Match all tags
- Filter by date ranges

Example of organized tagging:

```python
# What the agent does (agent tool call)

# Atomic memory with precise tags
archival_memory_insert(
    content="Nexus-6 replicants have a four-year lifespan",
    tags=["technical", "replicant", "nexus-6"]
)

# Later, easy retrieval
archival_memory_search(
    query="how long do replicants live",
    tags=["technical"]
)
```

## Performance and scale

<Info>
Archival memory has no practical size limits and remains fast at scale:

**Letta Cloud:** Uses [TurboPuffer](https://turbopuffer.com/) for extremely fast semantic search, even with hundreds of thousands of memories.

**Self-hosted:** Uses pgvector (PostgreSQL) for vector search. Performance scales well with proper indexing.

**Letta Desktop:** Uses SQLite with vector search extensions. Suitable for personal use cases.

No matter the backend, archival memory scales to large archives without performance degradation.
</Info>

## Embedding models and search quality

Archival search quality depends on the agent's embedding model:

**Letta Cloud:** All agents use `text-embedding-3-small`, which is optimized for most use cases. This model cannot be changed.

**Self-hosted:** Embedding model is pinned to the agent at creation. The default `text-embedding-3-small` is sufficient for nearly all use cases.

### Changing embedding models (self-hosted only)

To change an agent's embedding model, you must:
1. List and export all archival memories
2. Delete all archival memories
3. Update the agent's embedding model
4. Re-insert all memories (they'll be re-embedded)

<Warning>
Changing embedding models is a destructive operation. Export your archival memories first.
</Warning>

## Programmatic access (SDK)

Developers can manage archival memory programmatically via the SDK:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
// Insert a memory
await client.agents.passages.insert(agent.id, {
    content: "The Voight-Kampff test requires a minimum of 20 cross-referenced questions",
    tags: ["technical", "testing", "protocol"]
});

// Search memories
const results = await client.agents.passages.search(agent.id, {
    query: "testing procedures",
    tags: ["protocol"],
    page: 0
});

// List all memories
const passages = await client.agents.passages.list(agent.id, {
    limit: 100
});

// Get a specific memory
const passage = await client.agents.passages.get(agent.id, passageId);
```
```python Python
# Insert a memory
client.agents.passages.insert(
    agent_id=agent.id,
    content="The Voight-Kampff test requires a minimum of 20 cross-referenced questions",
    tags=["technical", "testing", "protocol"]
)

# Search memories
results = client.agents.passages.search(
    agent_id=agent.id,
    query="testing procedures",
    tags=["protocol"],
    page=0
)

# List all memories
passages = client.agents.passages.list(
    agent_id=agent.id,
    limit=100
)

# Get a specific memory
passage = client.agents.passages.get(
    agent_id=agent.id,
    passage_id=passage_id
)
```
